## Introduction

A self check in page for a hotel with html and java script.

## Features

The site has a basic html layout but has two key java script features. The pop up modal comes in the form of a 
welcome message that blurs the background when it is active. There is a short message to give the user a little starter info
to get them on track with checking in.

The second feature on the site is a form with validation features. The page shows error messages when the fields are not complete
correctly. The user must input the information as required by the java script code to check in.

There is a successful pop up when the form is complete to finish off the user experience.

## Debugging

Here I got some error messages with my java script code but it didn't seem to affect the flow of the user experience visusally.

I left it as it is because unitl now,when I change it according to the error, the java scrpit doesn't run.
